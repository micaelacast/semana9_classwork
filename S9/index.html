  	<div class= "p"> Longevial is an art director and illustrator based in Paris, whose beautiful paintings of intertwined bodies are likely to have you looking twice. She breaks up the human figure into segments in a fashion Picasso himself would admire, rendering different parts in contrasting but muted colour palettes to disguise the physicality of her subjects.  </div>

  	<div class= "p">  I’m a hair-twirler, thumb-twiddler, knuckle-cracker, and avid embroideress. My fingers are constantly moving over some surface – twisting, pulling, scraping, poking. I would call them nimble. I choose art because my fingers would harden to rock if they weren’t constantly lubricated by joint fluid. For me, art is meditation. It is timeless, limitless, and lawless. I enjoy the way tiny acts accumulate into a giant experience. </div>
